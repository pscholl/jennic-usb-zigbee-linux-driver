	---help---
	  This option enables the hardware independent IEEE 802.15.4
	  networking stack for SoftMAC devices (the ones implementing
	  only PHY level of IEEE 802.15.4 standard).

	  Note: this implementation is neither certified, nor feature
	  complete! We do not garantee that it is compatible w/ other
	  implementations, etc.

	  If you plan to use HardMAC IEEE 802.15.4 devices, you can
          say N here. Alternatievly you can say M to compile it as
	  module.
